# Write a function, isPermPalindrome, that will test if a given string is a permutation of a palindrome.
# Function Name: isPermPalindrome
# Input: a String consisting only of lowercase letter characters
# Output: a boolean, true if the string is a permutation of a palindrome and false if the string is not a permutation of a palindrome
# Examples:
# isPermPalindrome("kayak") => true
# isPermPalindrome("yakak") => true

#receive a string and count how many times each unique letter appears
#if all letters have an even number of appearances then String is a permutation of a palindrome
#else if there's only one letter that appears an odd number of times, String is still a permutation of a palindrome
#if there's more than one letter with an odd number of appearances then String is not a permutation of a palindrome

# [Basic difficulty]
# imports
from collections import Counter

    letter_counter = list(Counter(String).values()) #this gets me a list containg how many times each letter appears in String
    odd_count = 0 #this will count how many unique letters in string appear a odd number of times

#[Intermediate difficulty]
# As above, but isPermPalindrome should now be able to account for punctuation, spaces, and capitalization in the input string.
# Your input string may now include spaces, numbers, punctuation, and capitalization, but in assessing whether the string is a palindrome or not, spaces, punctuation, and capitalization does not matter. For example, akyKa is a permutation of Kayak, but we don't care that there is one upper case K and one lower case k in Kayak â€“ this is still a palindrome.
# Example: isPermPalindrome("Science Bros.") => false

def isPermPalindrome_int(String):
    strippred_String = '' #will hold String filtered of spaces, punctuation and capitalized letters
    for char in String.lower(): #this gets rid of capitalized letters right off the bat
        # print('char =>',char)
        if char == ' ': #ignore spaces
            pass
        elif char.isalnum() == False: #if char is not a letter or a digit ignore it
            pass
        else: #if char is a letter or a digit then add it to strippred_String
            strippred_String += char
    # print('strippred_String =>', strippred_String)
    letter_counter = list(Counter(strippred_String).values()) #creates a list containg how many times each letter appears in String
    
    odd_count = 0 #this will count how many unique letters in string appear a odd number of times
    
    for num in letter_counter: #now use this loop to check how many unique letters have an odd number of appearances
        if num%2 == 0:
            pass
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    
    #if there's more than one unique letter that appears an odd number of times in String return False; else return True
